🚨 D-RRAS: Disaster Relief & Resource Allocation System : 

A C++-based disaster management simulation platform that leverages advanced data structures and algorithms (DSA) to model real-time decision-making during emergency situations. D-RRAS focuses on routing optimization, dynamic road block management, multilingual alerting, and volunteer coordination — emphasizing logic, not UI.

📌 Full Feature Set : 

⚙️ Algorithmic Core

✅ Priority Queue (Heap): Handles incoming rescue/help requests by severity and timestamp.

📍 Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Calculates the shortest and safest evacuation paths.

🎯 Dynamic Programming (Knapsack): Optimizes resource allocation under constraints.

⚡ Greedy Matching: Assigns volunteers based on skill proximity and availability.

⛔ Real-Time Road Block Handling: Updates graph edges dynamically during routing.

🧠 AI-Inspired Priority Scoring: Simulates urgency-based triaging logic.

🛠️ Functional Modules : 

🚨 Rescue Request System: Accepts and prioritizes emergency help/resource requests.

🙋 Volunteer Management System: Register, display, and allocate volunteers based on skills and location. Data is stored persistently.

🌍 Multilingual User Interface: Available in 🇬🇧 English, 🇫🇷 French, and 🇪🇸 Spanish.

🧭 Predictive Evacuation Paths: Suggests escape routes that avoid high-risk or blocked roads.

🚧 Dynamic Road Block System: Block/unblock roads on the fly and auto-adjust pathfinding.

🔔 Real-Time Disaster Alerts: Triggers alerts for disaster-prone zones based on traffic and request load.

🌡️ Resource Heatmap Simulation: Highlights cities with high resource demand via simulated clustering.

📞 Helpline Directory: Displays emergency contact numbers in the selected language.

🧰 Precautionary & Medical Tips: Built-in safety and first aid guidance.

💾 Persistent Storage via File I/O: Logs of requests, volunteers, and routing information stored in structured .txt format.
